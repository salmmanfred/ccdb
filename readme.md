# ccdb:  The cmd game engine  
(Thats also multi threaded)  
  
# How to use  
  
[Tutorial](https://github.com/salmmanfred/ccdb/blob/master/help/tutorial.md)
  
# Multi threading  
If you want to use multi threading you have to use ACore  
The amount of threads cannot be odd  
If you have more threads than lines the program will crash  
  
# Contributing  
If you have linux it would be nice if you could test the keyin and cursor libraries to see if they will work on linux!
